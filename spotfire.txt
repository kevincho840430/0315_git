You can insert custom expression in cross table instead of calculated column to avoid grand total being summed up.

Sum([Completed])/Sum([Neg Tar])

This should give the same values as you are currently seeing through calculated value and grand total value will be based on total completed/total neg tar i.e. 8.5/8

The format of your desired visualization will effect the exact implementation. But here is how you do nested aggregations in general - with the THEN keword:

Assuming you have your data table above, the following axes expressions would give you that 55 (Note: your [Value] column is renamed to [myValue] to avoid confusion with the built in [Value] keyword entitity used with the THEN expression):

X-axis: %lt;[Item]%gt;
Y-axis: Avg([myValue]), Avg([myValue]) THEN Sum([Value]) OVER (All([Axis.X]))
Colr by: (Column Names)
