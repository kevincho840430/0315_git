I have a crosstable with a calculated column called "% completed", which is the division of two other columns "Completed" and "Neg Target" in the table (i.e % Completed = completed/Neg Target) .

When the grand total for the columns is selected the calculated column is being aggragetated by "sum" (i.e the calculated column is summed).

Is there anyway to remove this for the calculated column and keep for the rest of the column or  instead of being summed can the calculated column's  cell value be calculated  based on the expression?
